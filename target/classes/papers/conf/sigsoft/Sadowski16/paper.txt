ABSTRACT
This talk describes the developer workflow at Google, and our use of program analysis, testing, metrics, and tooling to reduce errors when creating and committing changes to source code. Software development at Google has several unique characteristics such as our monolithic codebase and distributed hermetic build system. Changes are vetted both manually, via our internal code review tool, and automatically, via sources such as the Tricorder program analysis platform and our automated testing infrastructure.
